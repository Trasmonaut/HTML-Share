## Overview

HTML Share is a collection of my custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript snippets and components.
It’s essentially a sandbox and portfolio in one — a place where I:

🖌️ Experiment with front-end design ideas

🔧 Build reusable components for future projects

🎨 Showcase random UI concepts and layouts

📂 Keep everything organized for quick reference

The main goal is to create a flexible library of designs and code blocks that I can reuse across personal projects, share with others, and continuously expand as I learn new techniques.

## Features

✨ Pure HTML/CSS/JS – no heavy frameworks required

📱 Responsive layouts where possible

🎭 Variety of styles – cards, buttons, grids, animations, etc.

📖 Well-structured snippets for easy copy/paste into projects
